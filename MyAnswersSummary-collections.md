## CollectionsTest

#### should_go_through_an_iterator / create_list
1. Use hasNext and Next Iterators for iterating an array list
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~srollins/courses/cs112-f07/web/notes/iterators.html
2. It failed at first because the implementation is blank.
3. Corrected it by using while loop then iterate values came from iterator then add it in list.
4. None.


#### should_reflects_back_to_original_list_for_sub_range
1. Learning in using sublist and clear methods.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arraylist-sublist-method-in-java-with-examples/
2. It failed at first because the initial value is 0.
3. Corrected it by listing all the integers that was added, identify values included in the sublist and remove it from the whole list. The remaining is the expected answer
4. None.
